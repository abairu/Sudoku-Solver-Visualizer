# Sudoku-Solver-Visualizer
A little project that was inspired by the Leetcode problem 'Sudoku Solver'. It takes a solvable Sudoku puzzle (here we use the test case given by Leetcode) and solves it while displaying the problem-solving process on a Sudoku board. 

We use recursion with backtracking to solve the Sudoku puzzle and the PyGame library to draw the Sudoku board along with its entries.
